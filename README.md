# Cypress-Fundamentals

Repository created to practice how to create and run Cypress tests.
To understand more about the fundamentals for Cypress, here is the Medium page where I wrote my notes: https://medium.com/@grisonrf/cypress-23b504137687

How to run Cypress locally:

After copying this repository to your computer, the next steps are:

Go to **app** folder:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Go to **api** folder:
```
npm install
npm start
```

In the **root** page:
```
npm install
npx cypress open
```

Now you can start using Cypress!
